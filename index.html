            Course Description: Overview of user interface design. Evaluation
            and testing of user interfaces. Review of principles of object
            orientation, object-oriented design and analysis using UML in the
            context of user interface design. Design of windows, menus, and
            commands. Developing Web and Windows-based user- interfaces.
            Event-driven programming. Introduction to Frameworks and APIs for
            the construction of user interfaces. Some key areas we want to focus
            on and investigate are: User Interfaces: Design principles for user
            interfaces, design issues, user interface construction (UI), user
            experiences (UX), and testing of user interfaces. Basic concepts:
            Process vs. thread, client/server applications. Event-driven
            programming: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), web
            user interfaces, web programming (JavaScript, Node.js, client/server
            programming), event-driven architecture, event-driven programming in
            JavaScript, and Node.js, windows-based user- interfaces, APIs and
            frameworks. Object-oriented analysis using UML: System modeling,
            behavioral and structural modeling, UML diagrams, interaction
            diagrams. Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD): Unit
            testing (JavaScript) and UI testing.

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>
              The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
              only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
              creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
              Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
              text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include two
              images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
              related to the project itself.
